# Table Data Filtering

This project provides a table component that allows users to filter and search through data. It's designed to handle large datasets by enabling efficient filtering and user-friendly navigation.

## Features

- **Data Display**: Presents data in a structured table format.
- **Filtering**: Users can apply filters to narrow down the displayed data based on various criteria.
- **Searching**: Provides a search bar to filter data by keywords or specific fields.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The table updates dynamically as users apply filters or perform searches.

## Implementation Details

The table with filtering functionality is built using React, which allows for smooth state management and user interactions. Key features include:

- **Search Functionality**: A search bar filters the data in real-time based on the user's input.
- **Filter Options**: Users can apply different filters to view subsets of the data.
- **State Management**: React state is used to manage the current search query and active filters.
